- Description of Problem:
```
Image segmentation is the process of identifying regions within the image that share similar properties, such as regions belonging to the same object within the image, belonging to similar classes of objects, sharing similar color profiles, etc. [ref] Segmenting images, can therefore, make the analysis of images easier [ref]. This is particularly useful in applications such as feature recognition, self-driving cars and medical imaging. In applications such as self-driving cars, only segmenting images into regions is not very useful. Instead, understanding what the regions consitute is more important. Therefore, semantically segmenting images by the type of objects and with proper understanding of what those objects signify has become a common approach in such applications. Taking the self-driving cars as an example, semantically segmenting the images can help the car detect the different kinds of obstacles present in front of it, the different types of signs present on the road, traffic signals, etc [ref]. Combined with LiDAR point clouds, semantically segmented images can also be used in 3D modeling the objects observed by the cars [ref]. Semantically segmented images can provide better detailed information (such as the exact shape of the objects) of the scene and LiDAR points, which are inherently more noisy and less detailed, can provide the depth required to better understand the 3D orientation of the objects in the scene. However, a lot of objects present in the semantically segmented images can have boundaries that are represented by very high degree curves, such as bounndaries of vegetation (such as trees and bushes), humans present in the scene, water bodies (such as puddles) and dirt trails in offroad conditions [FIG] and so on. While this provides highly detailed and accurate representations of the objects, it can also lead to difficulty in reconstructing the geometric models of these objects in the LiDAR point cloud space. Generating mesh, for example will lead to much finer meshes near the curved boundaries of the objects, which might not necessarily be of much importance for self-driving cars. As such, having a multi-level of detail representation of these objects can be more useful rather than having the same level of detail for all object classes. 

The problem of multi-level of detail representation of the objects can be mitigated in the image space, specifically in the semantically segmented images, where the detailed boundaries of less crucial objects, such as the branches of trees can be simplified into smoother curves, thus resulting in simpler, less complex shapes. This can also be an important technique to represent objects that are far in the scene through simpler shapes by geometrically smoothing the boundaries while maintaining continuity in the labels of the images. Therefore, my main goal in this project is to explore ways in which the boundaries of objects within the semantically segmented images can be geometrically simplified into different levels of details, which can then be used to generate multi-level of detail meshes to represent the objects. The mesh generation part of the problem is simply an application and the main focus of the problem is the simplification of the semantically segmented images.

Currently, my proposed approach to this problem is to combine the techniques of skeletonization of objects (shapes) present in the segmented images, simplifying the skeletons using different skeleton pruning techniques and then reconstructing the segmented shapes by generating voronoi diagrams, using pruned skeleton points as the voronoi cites. Multi-level of detail aspect of the problem can be observed in a variety of different ways: resampling reduced number of points along the skeletal representation of the images, different levels of pruning of the skeletons.
